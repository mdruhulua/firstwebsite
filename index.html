<p>Hello there, and welcome to my homepage! My name is Biplab Paul, and I am a postdoctoral fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. I work in Dr. Alan Mullen's group primarily on the gene expression of liver tissue. My goal from this postdoc fellowship is 
  to map the variation of gene expression accross different regions of the human liver tissue. This will ultimately help us to understand how changes in the gene
  expression across different regions of the liver tissue leads to diseases.

I maintain a list of my publications, previous research projects under the <a href="research">Research</a> tab, and a list of other non-research projects under the <a href="projects">Projects</a> tab. You may also check out my <a href="https://github.com/biplabua">Github profile.</a><br><br>

To get a better insight on my life so far, you can have a look at my <a href="cv">curriculum vitae</a>. I blog and pin them down <a href="blog">here</a>. Feel free to read a bit more <a href="about">about me</a>.</p>
