<p>Hello there, and welcome to my homepage! My name is Md Ruhul Amin, and I am a PhD candidate at Department of Biological Science, University of Alberta. I am working in Dr. Declan Ali's group, studying the effect of cannabis on the development of zebrafish. My goal is 
  to study the developmental effects of cannabinoid on developing organism. All I am trying to understand is what happens to the baby if an women takes marijuana during early pregnancy while it remains undetected. This will ultimately help us to developm a safer guideline of using marijuana during pregnancy.

I maintain a list of my publications, previous research projects under the <a href="research">Research</a> tab, and a list of other non-research projects under the <a href="projects">Projects</a> tab. You may also check out my <a href="https://github.com/mdruhulua/firstwebsite">Github profile.</a><br><br>

To get a better insight on my life so far, you can have a look at my <a href="cv">curriculum vitae</a>. I blog and pin them down <a href="blog">here</a>. Feel free to read a bit more <a href="about">about me</a>.</p>
