I am Md Ruhul Amin, born and grown up in Bangladesh. After completion of the undergraduate degree from the Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering Discipline at Khulna University, I moved to Canada to pursue my graduate study. I have completed Masters in Biochemistry from the University of Lethbridge, under supervision of Dr. Marc Roussel, who is a great mentor and inspiration for me. I used computation and mathmetical modeling to study photosynthesis and photorespiration. Next, I thought, I would gain some experience in wet lab moved to UofA. While working as research assistant, I gained hands on experience on Confocal, Scanning electron (SEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Finaly, In fall 2015, I joined at the Department of Biological Science as a PhD student at Dr. Ali lab. My PhD research focuses on studying the effect of cannabinoids on neurodevelopment of zebrafish. During my PhD I used electrophysiology, RT-qPCR, In-situ and behavioral experiments (embryos and adult) along with microscopy (confocal, SEM and TEM).
