I am Biplab Paul, born and grown up in Bangladesh. After completion of the undergraduate degree from the Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering Discipline at Khulna University, I moved to Canada to pursue my graduate study. I have completed Masters in Biochemistry from the University of Regina, under supervision of Dr. Tanya Dahms, who is a great mentor and inspiration for me. I used atomic force microscopy to elucidate the surface ultrastructure of the filamentous fungus *Aspergillus nidulans*. I thought, I would continue in the field of bionanotechnology, so decided to persue PhD at Dahms group. But shortly after the begining of PhD at her lab, I became very interested in molecular cell biology, when I told Tanya about my interest, she was very supportive to my decision to leave her lab. In fall 2013, I joined at the Department of Cell Biology, University of Alberta as a PhD student at Dr. Ben Montpetit lab. My PhD research focuses on RNA Biology, more specifically how the accumulation of polyadenylated ncRNA affect overall gene expression in eukaryotic cell. At the middle of my PhD program, my supervisor took a position at University of California, Davis and I moved with him to Davis, California. Although changing of the country at middle of PhD affected my research output, I really enjoyed my time at Davis, California. At the end of my PhD I became interested in the field of ncRNA, therefore decided to pursue postdoctoral study with Dr. Alan Mullen at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School to study ncRNA biology and liver diseases.
